    "lyrics": "So, so you think you can tell\nHeaven from hell?\nBlue skies from pain?\nCan you tell a green field\nFrom a cold steel rail?\nA smile from a veil?\nDo you think you can tell?\n\nDid they get you to trade\nYour heroes for ghosts?\nHot ashes for trees?\nHot air for a cool breeze?\nCold comfort for change?\nDid you exchange\nA walk on part in the war\nFor a lead role in a cage?\n\nHow I wish\nHow I wish you were here\nWe're just two lost souls\nSwimming in a fish bowl year after year\nRunning over the same old ground\nWhat have we found?\nThe same old fears\nWish you were here",
